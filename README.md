Simulation of simple optical systems, estimation of geometrical distortion of the image and such.

Hobby project that I started when I wanted to estimate the geometrical distortion that I would introduce into the projector image if I added a lens to increase the throw length of the projector. At the same time I wanted to keep my Kotlin skills from decay.
